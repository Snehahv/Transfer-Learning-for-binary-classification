# Transfer-Learning-for-binary-classification
## Aim
To Implement Transfer Learning for Horses_vs_humans dataset classification using InceptionV3 architecture.
## Problem Statement and Dataset
Develop and train a binary classification model to distinguish between images of horses and humans using transfer learning with the InceptionV3 model. The task involves using both training and validation datasets, implementing data augmentation, and defining custom callbacks to stop training when a target accuracy is reached.

</br>

## DESIGN STEPS
### STEP 1:
Load and prepare image data for training and validation.
</br>

### STEP 2:
Build a model using pre-trained InceptionV3 with additional layers for binary classification.
</br>

### STEP 3:
Train the model on the data and stop early when accuracy reaches 97%.
<br/>
### Step 4:
Plot the accuracy and loss for both training and validation.
